Just another repository

Hi folks! 

Preston at your service. I am just a dood out here and wanted to learn some new skills. So far, 
I have had formal training in python, java and sql for programming languages. 

I have also taught myself how to use many other tools related to additive manufacturing(3D printing) for rapid prototyping.
